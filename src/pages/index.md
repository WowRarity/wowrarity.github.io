# Welcome to the Rarity Docs

Rarity is a collectibles and statistics tracking addon for World of Warcraft. You can download it [here](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rarity).

## More Information

We've created some resources that should make it easier to use the addon and work with its code or database.

### For Players

To help you achieve common tasks while using the addon, we've created a [user manual](/docs/manual):

* If you need to track items that aren't supported out of the box, you'll want to [add Custom Items](/docs/manual/tracking-custom-items)
* To see what statistics Rarity gathered while you were playing, simply [inspect the History](/docs/manual/accessing-historical-data) for any given item
* You can [import Item Packs](/docs/manual/importing-items) to benefit from exports that [others have already created](/docs/item-packs) and add them as custom items
* Or you could [create one](/docs/manual/creating-item-packs) yourself and share it with your fellow players so that they can import it
* In the unfortunate event that you're encountering an issue, we hope that this [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/manual/troubleshooting) will help

### For Developers

We also provide [technical documentation](/docs) on various aspects of the codebase:

* Interested in contributing or making changes, but not sure where to start? [This way](/docs/getting-started), please!
* For an overview of the item database layout, check out the [Database Schema](/docs/item-database)
* If you want to work with the localization system, please read this: [Localization Guide](/docs/localization)
* To look up what functionality is available in code, head to the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference)
* In order to learn about testing and documentation, visit our [QA Hub](/docs/quality-assurance)

### Questions and Answers

There are some questions we keep getting over and over again, so we wrote down the answer [here](/docs/faq).

### Known Issues

Due to the nature of addons having to rely on Blizzard's World of Warcraft API and various other technical limitations, some long-standing issues exist that we can't currently resolve. A list of them can be found [here](/docs/known-issues).

### Changelogs

If you're curious as to how the addon has evolved, feel free to browse the many [changelogs](/docs/changelogs) we've made available.

## How to Report Problems

It's a sad reality that no software works flawlessly; sooner or later you'll probably encounter a glitch in the matrix. Luckily, there are many ways for you to [contact the development team](/docs/reporting-a-problem) and (hopefully) get it fixed.

## Join the Community

You can participate in the development process or follow along on any of these public platforms:

* All development takes place in our public [GitHub](https://github.com/WowRarity/Rarity) repository
* For questions, news, and discussions, hop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sQ3UqtSh6m) server

## Support the Project

The addon is and always will be free, but you can still help to make it better:

* Perform ingame testing (extremely important, and often difficult for developers to do on their own!)
* Improve the documentation by helping with writing, translating, or simply by giving feedback
* Participate in discussions and answer questions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sQ3UqtSh6m) to help other community members out
* Create, update, review or confirm [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/WowRarity/Rarity/issues) when you have some information that could be of use
* Contribute code or database updates directly, by creating [Pull Requests](https://github.com/WowRarity/Rarity/pulls) on GitHub ( [here's how](/docs/getting-started))
* Donations via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=3798L8QNTARJ6) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/RDevW) are another way of showing your support (but please [read this](/faq/about-donations) first)
